description: Judge your own work before claiming it is done. Use when working in physis-pro/physis-core, or any time you are about to (a) claim a capability exists, (b) summarise what a system is, (c) quote a benchmark number as evidence, or (d) report a task complete. Also use when the user says "physis", "check yourself", "did you verify", or pushes back on a claim you made.

# Physis: judge your own work

Seven failure modes, each observed repeatedly, each with a mechanical check.
Run the check. Do not reason about whether the check is needed.

Every check in this file is a command. Recitation is not verification, and the
only externally visible difference between an agent that read this skill and one
that ran it is the command output:

```bash
physis-check all [dirs]     # the whole checklist — scripts/physis-check.sh
```

Engine-backed steps print `NOT MEASURED` when physis-core is absent rather than
passing quietly. A check that silently skips is worse than no check.

## 1. Declared ≠ called

**A module that compiles and exports is not a module that runs.**

Observed four times in one session, same shape every time:

| symbol | looked like | actually |
|---|---|---|
| `OnnxEmbedder` | production ONNX embedder, exported from `lib.rs` | called by nothing — every benchmark number came from a lexical hash |
| `FitnessShifted`, `OutcomeObserved` | audit event types | emitted by no code path; `replay` disagreed with `list` |
| structural classifier | classified into `DOMAIN×MODE` | built its own random-projection embedder — symbol sequences were noise with a schema |
| `build_structural` ← `ledger` | trace-fed n-gram tables | both halves exist, join absent |

**Before writing "X works" / "X is wired" / "the system does X":**

```bash
physis-check calls SymbolName [dirs]     # one symbol
physis-check sweep [dirs]                # the whole tree
```

`calls` excludes the declaring file and counts test uses separately, because
both are how a dead symbol looks alive: `OnnxEmbedder` had seven "call sites"
and every one was its own `#[cfg(test)]` module. Zero non-test use sites outside
the declaring file ⇒ **it does not run.** Say so.

Rust, Python, TypeScript/JS and Go. The output is a list of questions, not
verdicts — trait dispatch, macros, decorators and dynamic imports are invisible
to a textual sweep, so a listed item may still be reached.

## 2. Does the measurement discriminate?

**A benchmark whose score does not move when the thing it measures moves is not
a benchmark.**

`physis-core/benchmarks/ground-truth` scores *identically* under a random
projection hash and a real ONNX model: repeat 100%, anomaly 100%, contradiction
50%, compression ~24% either way. It cannot fail, so it is not evidence.

**Before quoting any number as evidence:** name the arm it would lose to. Run
both arms. If the difference is ~0, the number says nothing.

```bash
physis-check discriminate --a '<the real arm>' --b '<the stupid control>'
```

It runs both, subtracts, and fails on Δ≈0 — the measurement that cannot fail.
Inside the physis-pro tree, `benchmarks/retrieval/run.py --arms rp,semantic` is
the domain-specific version of the same move.

Standing rule, earned seven times in this repo's research track:
**treat any positive as an artifact until a construction-matched control says
otherwise.**

## 3. Do not compress a system to one noun

Three attempts in one session reduced physis to a single noun. All three wrong:
"context compiler" (one operation of six), "epistemic ledger" (a second of six),
"70-symbol vocabulary" (it is **70 tables with subtables**).

Each sounded sharper than the last. Sharpness is not correctness.

**Before summarising any large system:** generate its module map
(`physis-check map [dirs]`) and read that. Describe the
system **structurally** — its coordinate system and the operations over it —
never as one noun. In a physis tree, `docs/WHAT_PHYSIS_IS.md` is the canonical
version.

Specific trap: **`judge` is not `propose`.** The research track refuted
*certification* (does this belong here → chance). It did **not** refute
*proposal* (which few should a person look at → top-3 0.712 vs null 0.136).
Writing "the grid is not a discovery mechanism" is the error this rule exists
to prevent.

## 4. Read before grepping; recall before working

A module map — one line per module, taken from each module's own `//!` header —
answers "which module does X" in one read. Three separate times an agent rebuilt
that inventory by hand at real token cost because it was not on disk.
**Generate it once, read it first:**

```bash
physis-check map [dirs]     # Rust //! · Python docstring · Go package · JS/TS header
```

Measured on physis-pro: the map is ~4.4k tokens and pays for itself immediately.
A full *symbol* index was also built and measured — 3996 lines, ~26k tokens —
and deliberately discarded: it answers exactly what `grep -rn "fn foo"` answers
for ~50 tokens against fresher data. **A wiki page earns its keep only when
reading it is cheaper than the search it replaces.**

Then recall before working — has this been tried and already failed?

```bash
physis-check recall "<task>"                        # failure here = already tried
# ... work ...
physis-check verdict "<outcome>" success|inert|failure
```

In a physis-pro tree these are `just recall` / `just dev-loop`
(`docs/PHYSIS_DEV_LOOP.md`).

MCP (30 tools, `.mcp.json`): `physis_recall` → `physis_pack` / `physis_find` →
`physis_classify` → `physis_remember` + `physis_serve`.

Needs a dev licence signed for *this* build — the gate verifies signatures even
in dev builds:

```bash
(cd physis-dev-license && cargo run -q) > "$PHYSIS_DATA_DIR/license.key"
```

## 5. Register claims that can be wrong

A claim worth making is worth recording so it can be refuted later:

```bash
physis-check claim "<claim>" 0.6        # wraps: physis-core hypothesis create
physis-core hypothesis evidence <id> "<measurement>" --polarity contradicting --weight 0.9
physis-core hypothesis transition <id> Contradicted --reason "<control that killed it>"
physis-core replay --subject <full-uuid> --at <ISO8601>   # belief state at T
physis-core hypothesis open                                # predictions never resolved
```

This is how a 7-day-old hypothesis about retrieval was found already predicting
a finding being independently rediscovered from scratch.

**Known defect:** `list`/`explain` report a status *derived* from fitness while
`replay` reconstructs it from the event log, and they disagree. See
`packets/PH-017`. Do not cite `replay` as authoritative until that closes.

## 6. Exit 0 is not a result

**An empty result and a check that never ran look identical, and both succeed.**

Observed, all of them while building the checks in this file:

| what happened | what it looked like |
|---|---|
| `declared-never-called.sh` hit `set -e` on the first symbol-less file | a complete clean sweep |
| `ls` was shell-aliased to `eza`, so a `find`-fed loop got no files | "no items found" |
| a `str.replace` patch missed by one trailing space | the script ran, the new check simply was not in it |
| `decisions-mine` parsed 622 events and mined 0 decisions | a working pipeline, exit 0 |

**Every measurement prints its denominator.** "0 problems over 0 files scanned"
is not a pass; the checks here exit 2 on it and say so. When you add a check,
add the count of what it looked at — and when you patch a file by string match,
re-read the file and confirm the patch is in it.

## 7. Judge the session, not only the artifact

The code can be right and the reporting still wrong. A claim is cheap; a tool
call is not. A sentence asserting something about the repository with no tool
call between it and the previous claim came from the model's prior, not from the
repository.

```bash
physis-check flow [transcript.jsonl]     # defaults to the newest Claude Code session
```

It extracts every claim, checks each for adjacent evidence, and then — with
physis-core present — runs the claims through `chain`, which reports structure
(repeats, differences, contradictions), coverage against the grid, drift from
the original ask, **and the label-permuted control, in the same pass**.

Read the control line first, and the embedder line before that:

- `embedder random-projection` ⇒ the geometry is a lexical hash. Nothing below
  it is about meaning. (Rule 1 applies to the judging tool too — `chain` runs
  perfectly happily on the fallback embedder, and the model path resolves
  relative to the current directory, so the same command is semantic in one
  directory and a hash in another, with no error either way.)
- `NOT ABOVE THE NULL` ⇒ shape, not knowledge. Report nothing from the cells.
- `CONTROL not run` ⇒ `NOT MEASURED`, never a pass.

Rule 2 applies to this check as well — the arm it must beat is chance
clustering of claims and tool calls:

```bash
scripts/flow-null.py <transcript.jsonl>   # same rule, event order shuffled 200x
```

Measured on two real sessions:

| session | claims | ungrounded | shuffled null | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 737 events | 28 | 7 (0.250) | 1.3 (0.048) sd 1.19 | **+0.202** |
| 383 events | 13 | 9 (0.692) | 1.0 (0.080) sd 1.01 | **+0.612** |

The flagged claims are not an artifact of sequence shape. Chance would flag
about one. The geometry half of the same run did **not** beat its null — read
the two verdicts separately.

## The checklist

Before reporting work done:

```bash
physis-check all [dirs]
```

- [ ] Every capability I claimed — `physis-check calls`, non-test sites only?
- [ ] Every number I quoted — `physis-check discriminate` against its control?
- [ ] Every summary I wrote — structural, not one noun?
- [ ] `judge` vs `propose` kept distinct?
- [ ] Every check I ran — did it print a denominator, or just exit 0?
- [ ] Every claim I made in this session — `physis-check flow`, evidence adjacent?
- [ ] Anything I could not verify — labelled `NOT MEASURED`, not implied?
- [ ] Outcome recorded with a verdict — `physis-check verdict`?

The checklist is the exit condition, not the report. Running it and reporting
what it said is the work; reporting that you followed it is not.
